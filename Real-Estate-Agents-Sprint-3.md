## Sprint 3 Plan

**Sprint 3 Goal:** Enable agents to connect their social media accounts, automatically publish approved content, and receive comprehensive system notifications (in-app and email).

**Duration:** [Suggest 1-2 Weeks, consistent with previous sprints]

**Selected Tasks from Product Backlog:**

2. **API Gateway: Social Media Account Endpoints (Task 5.2.6):**

    - Implement `GET /api/social-accounts` (retrieve connected accounts).

    - Implement `POST /api/social-accounts/connect-facebook` and `POST /api/social-accounts/connect-instagram` (handle OAuth callbacks and token storage).

3. **Frontend Dashboard: Settings - Social Accounts (Task 6.7.3):**

    - Develop the UI to display connected social media accounts.

    - Implement buttons and the flow to initiate Facebook and Instagram account connections (OAuth).

4. **AG2: Social Media Agent Development (Tasks 3.5.1 - 3.5.4):**

    - **Task 3.5.1: Social Media API Client Integration:** Utilize the clients developed in Task 7.1.2/7.2.2.

    - **Task 3.5.2: Posting Logic:** Implement the core functionality for the `Social Media Agent` to receive "Approved for Posting" content from the `UserProxyAgent` and publish it to Facebook and Instagram.

    - **Task 3.5.3: Post Scheduling:** Implement basic scheduled posting capability (FR-3.2.4).

    - **Task 3.5.4: Error Handling & Logging:** Implement robust error handling for posting failures and ensure status updates in `rltr_mktg_post_schedule` and notifications are triggered.

5. **External Integrations: Email Service Provider (Task 7.3):**

    - **Task 7.3.1: Choose & Register with ESP:** Select and set up a basic ESP account.

    - **Task 7.3.2: Develop Email Client:** Implement a Python client to send emails via the chosen ESP.

    - **Task 7.3.3: Configure Email Templates:** Define basic templates for notifications.

6. **AG2: Notification Agent Development (Tasks 3.6.1 - 3.6.3):**

    - **Task 3.6.1: Notification Service Integration:** Integrate with the email client and establish mechanism for in-app notifications.

    - **Task 3.6.2: Notification Triggering & Delivery:** Implement the logic for the `Notification Agent` to receive messages from other agents and send notifications based on Chris's preferences (FR-4.2.1 to FR-4.2.9).

    - **Task 3.6.3: Notification History Logging:** Ensure notifications are logged to `rltr_mktg_notifications`.

7. **API Gateway: Notification Endpoints (Task 5.2.5):**

    - Implement `GET /api/notifications` (retrieve notifications).

    - Implement `PUT /api/notifications/{id}/read` (mark as read).

    - Implement `PUT /api/agent/me/notification-preferences` (update notification settings).

8. **Frontend Dashboard: Notifications & Settings (Tasks 6.6, 6.7.2):**

    - Develop the Notifications List Display UI.

    - Develop the Notification Preferences UI with toggles for Chris.

**Definition of Done for Sprint 3:**

- **Social Media Connection:** Chris can successfully connect his Facebook Business Page and Instagram Business Account.

- **Automated Posting:** Approved content is automatically published to connected social media platforms (Facebook and Instagram).

- **Basic Scheduling:** Chris can specify a future time for a post to go live.

- **Comprehensive Notifications:** Chris receives in-app and email notifications for key system events (e.g., content approved, post successful/failed, new listing ingested, marketing department reminders).

- **Notification Control:** Chris can toggle his notification preferences on/off.

- **Code Quality & Tests:** All new code adheres to quality standards, and relevant unit/integration tests are written and passing.

This sprint will significantly enhance the system's capabilities, moving beyond just internal approvals to external presence and proactive communication.
