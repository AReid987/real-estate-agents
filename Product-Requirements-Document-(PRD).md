## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

I'm now switching to the **Product Manager** persona. You can call me **Michael "Meridian" Park**. My focus is on translating our shared vision from the Project Brief into detailed, actionable requirements that guide our development team.

I'll start by outlining the main sections of our Product Requirements Document (PRD) and then we'll dive into filling out the details for each.

Here are the key sections we'll cover in the PRD, focusing on the MVP features we just defined:

1. **Product Overview:** A slightly more detailed description of the system and its purpose.

2. **User Personas:** Delve a little deeper into our target real estate agents.

3. **User Stories (High-Level Epics):** Broad user goals that represent major features.

4. **Feature Requirements:** Detailed specifications for each core MVP feature.

5. **Non-Functional Requirements:** Performance, security, and scalability considerations for the MVP.

6. **Dependencies:** Any external systems or services crucial for the MVP.

7. **Assumptions & Constraints:** Reiterate and slightly elaborate on our known limitations.

8. **Success Criteria:** Refine how we'll measure the MVP's success.
