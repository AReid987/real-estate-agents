### 4. Langflow Integration Tasks

This phase focuses on enabling the `Content Agent` to leverage Langflow's visual workflow capabilities for specific content generation and research tasks, ensuring seamless API interaction.

**4.1. Langflow Instance Setup & Initial Workflows**

- **Task 4.1.1: Deploy Langflow Instance (Local & Dev):**

    - Ensure the `langflow` service in `docker-compose.yml` is correctly configured and accessible to the `ag2-core` service.

    - Confirm environment variables for Langflow's database connection are set.

- **Task 4.1.2: Design Initial Langflow Workflows (MVP):**

    - **"Content Generation - Flyer Text" Workflow:** Create a Langflow workflow that takes structured listing data and agent details as input, uses an LLM (via Portkey) to generate the specific text elements for a digital flyer (headline, core property details, summary, agent contact info) as defined in FR-1.2.2. This workflow should expose a REST API endpoint.

    - **"Content Generation - Social Media Post Optimization" Workflow (Refined FR-1.2.1):** Create a Langflow workflow that takes initial raw social media post text (generated by the `Content Agent` or an LLM) and platform context (e.g., "Facebook," "Instagram") as input. It will then optimize the text, add relevant hashtags, and select appropriate emojis for the target platform. This workflow should also expose a REST API endpoint.

    - **"Research" Workflow (Future Consideration for MVP, or Post-MVP):** Acknowledge the user's idea for a "research workflow". For MVP, this might be a simpler LLM call within the `Content Agent` or a very basic Langflow flow. Its full potential as a complex research tool will be noted for post-MVP.

- **Task 4.1.3: Secure Langflow API Access:**

    - Understand how to obtain and manage authentication tokens from Langflow (e.g., via Datastax Langflow for managed service, or a local equivalent if self-hosted).

    - Securely store these tokens (e.g., in GitHub Secrets for CI/CD and as environment variables for runtime).

**4.2. Content Agent - Langflow Interaction**

- **Task 4.2.1: Develop Langflow API Client:**

    - Create a dedicated Python module (`tools/langflow_client.py` within `ag2-core`) that encapsulates the logic for making authenticated API calls to specific Langflow workflow endpoints.

    - This client will handle setting headers, including the `Authorization` bearer token.

- **Task 4.2.2: Integrate Langflow Calls into Content Agent:**

    - Modify the `Content Agent` to call the "Content Generation - Flyer Text" Langflow workflow, passing it the necessary `listing_id` and agent `details`.

        - **Data Sent:** Authentication token, details about the listing (e.g., address, features, description), agent contact info, and potentially information about the target ICP if relevant to the workflow's optimization.

        - **Data Expected Back:** Structured JSON containing the generated flyer headline, property details, summary, and agent contact information.

    - Modify the `Content Agent` to call the "Content Generation - Social Media Post Optimization" Langflow workflow.

        - **Data Sent:** Raw social media post text, platform (e.g., "facebook"), listing ID, and potentially optimization goals.

        - **Data Expected Back:** Optimized headline, body, hashtags, and emojis.

- **Task 4.2.3: Handle Langflow Responses & Errors:**

    - Implement robust error handling for Langflow API calls, including network errors (`requests.exceptions.RequestException`) and bad status codes (`response.raise_for_status()`).

    - Parse the JSON responses from Langflow to extract the generated content.

    - Ensure the `Content Agent` can gracefully handle cases where Langflow returns an error or unexpected output, perhaps by falling back to direct LLM calls or logging for human review.

**4.3. Future Consideration: Langflow as an Agent Tool**

- **Task 4.3.1 (Post-MVP Task): Explore Langflow as a Tool:** While not strictly MVP, investigate how a Langflow workflow itself could be exposed as a tool for another AG2 agent to use. This would be particularly relevant for complex "research" or "social media interaction/scheduling" workflows that might involve multiple steps within Langflow that an AG2 agent needs to orchestrate or trigger.
