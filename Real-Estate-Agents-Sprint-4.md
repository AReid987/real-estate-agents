## Sprint 4 Plan

**Sprint 4 Goal:** Complete all remaining MVP features, including advanced content generation via Langflow and the full Marketing Department approval workflow, and finalize testing, quality assurance, and CI/CD automation for pilot readiness.

**Duration:** [Suggest 1-2 Weeks, maintaining consistency]

**Selected Tasks from Product Backlog:**

1. **AG2: Content Agent - Langflow Integration (Tasks 4.1, 4.2):**

    - **Task 4.1.2: Design Initial Langflow Workflows:** Finalize and deploy the "Content Generation - Flyer Text" and "Content Generation - Social Media Post Optimization" workflows in Langflow.

    - **Task 4.2.2: Integrate Langflow Calls into Content Agent:** Implement the specific API calls from the `Content Agent` to these new Langflow workflows, leveraging the `tools/langflow_client.py`.

    - **Task 4.2.3: Handle Langflow Responses & Errors:** Ensure robust parsing and error handling for Langflow interactions.

2. **AG2: UserProxyAgent - Marketing Department Flow (Refinement & Completion) (Refined Tasks 3.4.2, 3.4.3):**

    - Complete the `UserProxyAgent`'s logic to handle the full lifecycle of "Send to Marketing Department for Approval" and "Record Marketing Department Response" actions, including status transitions and interactions with the `Notification Agent`.

3. **Frontend Dashboard: Content Approval View (Completion) (Task 6.5.3):**

    - Finalize the UI for the "Send to Marketing Department" button.

    - Implement the dedicated interface for "Record Marketing Department Response," including options for approval, rejection, or feedback input.

4. **Testing & QA (Tasks 1.4.2, 1.4.3, Phase 4-Testing & QA):**

    - **Task 1.4.2: End-to-End Testing Setup (**`Playwright`**):** Develop initial critical end-to-end test scenarios (e.g., full listing ingestion -> content generation -> approval -> posting flow).

    - **Task 1.4.3: Code Coverage Setup (**`Codecov`**):** Integrate `Codecov` reporting into test workflows.

    - **Task (New): Comprehensive Unit & Integration Test Coverage:** Review all implemented modules and agents, ensuring adequate unit and integration tests are in place for critical paths.

    - **Task (New): Manual User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Prep:** Prepare a small set of UAT scripts for Chris (our persona) to validate the end-to-end flow from a user perspective.

5. **CI/CD Pipeline Automation (Completion) (Tasks 1.5.3, 1.5.4, 1.5.2 Refinement):**

    - **Task 1.5.3: GitHub Actions Workflow for Docker Image Management:** Implement the workflow to build, tag, and push Docker images for all services.

    - **Task 1.5.4: Implement Dagger Pipelines in CI:** Set up the GitHub Actions workflow to invoke Dagger pipelines for `build_and_test` and `deploy_staging` actions, ensuring the entire system can be tested and deployed automatically.

    - **Task 1.5.2 Refinement: Autofixing:** Ensure GitHub Actions workflows for linting and testing include autofixing for test failures and linter errors.

6. **Documentation (Phase 4 - Documentation):**

    - **Task (New): Update READMEs:** Ensure `README.md` files for the monorepo root and each service (`frontend`, `ag2-core`, `api-gateway`, `dagger`) are up-to-date with setup, run instructions, and contribution guidelines.

    - **Task (New): Document API Endpoints:** Generate or manually document the `API Gateway` endpoints for internal developer reference.

**Definition of Done for Sprint 4:**

- **Content Generation via Langflow:** `Content Agent` successfully generates flyer text and optimized social media posts using Langflow workflows.

- **Full Marketing Department Workflow:** Chris can "Send to Marketing Department" and "Record Marketing Department Response" in the UI, and the system handles the associated status updates and notifications.

- **End-to-End Test Coverage:** Critical user flows are covered by automated Playwright tests, and code coverage is tracked.

- **Full CI/CD Automation:** GitHub Actions are fully configured to build, test (with autofixing), tag, and push Docker images, and deploy to staging via Dagger, on appropriate triggers.

- **MVP Feature Complete:** All features defined in the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the MVP are implemented and tested.

- **Documentation:** Basic developer documentation is in place for seamless handover and future work.

- **Pilot Ready:** The system is stable, functional, and ready for an initial pilot with Chris or other early adopters.
